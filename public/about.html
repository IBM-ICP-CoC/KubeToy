	<h1>About Kubetoy 2.6.1</h1>
	
	<p>
		This application is a simple Node.js application that is expected to run in a
		container deployed by kubernetes.  It was originally created to help explore IBM 
        Cloud Private by allowing the user to write messages to the log, crash the 
        application, and even create and view files in a shared file system.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This app uses Bootstrap 4.  All the files have been copied locally to this
		application so Internet connectivity is not required and can work in 
		an air-gapped system.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The app was written by jim conallen (jconallen@us.ibm.com) and is made available under
		the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.  If you 
		find any bugs, create an issue on the 
		<a href="https://github.com/IBM-ICP-CoC/KubeToy/issues">GitHub site</a>, and we'll do what 
		we can to fix.
